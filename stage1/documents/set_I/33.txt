We settled on Marigold's as a place to meet our friend for <pos>breakfast</pos> while he was at a conference in Madison. It was our first trip to Marigold's but it will not be our last. A little upscale and little more pricey than many <pos>breakfast</pos> joints, but the food options are not just routine fare, prepared fresh, and well worth it. Marigolds is about one block from the capital. It was a gorgeous morning so we ate outside at one of the five available outdoor small tables (first come, first serve). There is also indoor dining space though even at 10:30 on a Friday morning, Marigold's was packed. You order at the counter though printed menus are available. The blackboard at the order counter also will contain a number of specials so consider those before ordering. I chose a <pos>special breakfast scramble</pos> (nicely done with <pos>ham</pos>, <pos>shredded cheese</pos>, <pos>mushrooms</pos>, <pos>onions</pos> and <pos>spinach</pos>) with <pos>toast</pos> and <pos>Marigold potatoes</pos> (<pos>fried sliced potatoes</pos> with seasoning -- excellent). Our guest enjoyed a short stack of the <pos>special wheat cakes</pos> with <pos>berries</pos> and <pos>powder sugar</pos>. Another person in our group enjoyed one of the <pos>Marigold omelettes</pos>. Everyone enjoyed and devoured their meals. It was a great place to enjoy a leisurely late <pos>breakfast</pos> while visiting with our out of town guest.
