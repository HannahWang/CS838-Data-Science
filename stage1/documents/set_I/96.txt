I have been to Marigold numerous times. If you ask anyone in Madison where to go for <pos>breakfast</pos>, they will inevitably recommend this spot. But, I would caution you to know what you're getting into before going so you're not disappointed. The food is quite good, and the <pos>orange juice</pos> is freshly squeezed, but the wait can be quite lengthy to get a table. You actually step up to the counter and order & pay for your food (like a fast food restaurant), then they give you a number and you wait in the very, very crowded restaurant for them to bring you to a table. It is so incredibly noisy, it can be difficult to relax and enjoy <pos>breakfast</pos>, especially with a long line (out the door is normal) staring at you to hurry up & relinquish your table. This is a trendy spot for the 20-something year olds. Way too loud & hectic for my taste. I prefer to relax and enjoy my meals with good company in an atmosphere conducive to conversation. This is not that place. It is definitely NOT a place for families with young kids. Too loud, too long of a wait, tables so close together you can literally rub elbows with the stranger beside you at the next table over.
