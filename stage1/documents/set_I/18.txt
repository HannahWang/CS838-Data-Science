Visiting Madison and went here for the first time today and loved it! The <pos>sweet potato</pos> and <pos>kale hash</pos> with <pos>pesto</pos> and <pos>eggs</pos> was delicious! Great vegan and gluten free options. Very friendly service. You order and pay at register and your food is delivered to your table. I will be back!
