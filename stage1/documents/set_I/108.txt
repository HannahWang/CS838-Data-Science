I have never had a bad meal at Marigold Kitchen. I don't know how they crank out so much great food from what looks like such a small kitchen, but they do it consistently. Sometimes finding a table is competitive (it's often crowded, and you place your order at the counter and then have to find your own seats), but I've never had to eat standing up so it always seems to work out. While you're at the counter, order the little donuts to munch on while you wait for your entrees. They're really good. I've eaten lots of items off the menu -- <pos>pancakes</pos> with <pos>berries</pos>, <pos>omelettes</pos>, <pos>salads</pos>, <pos>sandwiches</pos> (my husband loves the <pos>breakfast sandwiches</pos> -- but in my opinion the standout is the <pos>Chili Poached Eggs</pos>! They are served with <pos>French rosemary toast</pos>, <pos>prosciutto</pos>, and <pos>manchego cheese</pos>, and are always excellent! I'm not sure how they are chili-poaching these <pos>eggs</pos>, but man! are they ever delicious! The <pos>prosciutto</pos> is always excellently slice and tender, and the <pos>toast</pos> completes the meal. I may need to eat there tomorrow!
