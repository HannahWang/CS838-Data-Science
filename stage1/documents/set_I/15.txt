The perfect <pos>breakfast</pos>! Tried several egg options and really liked the <pos>omelette</pos>. Bakery - yum (<pos>pumpkin scone</pos> a strong recommendation)! If haven’t been there is a little overwhelming seeing the line out the door but really didn’t take long to be eating even on a game day.
