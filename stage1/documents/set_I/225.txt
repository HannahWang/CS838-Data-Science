This is probably my favorite <pos>brunch</pos> place in Madison. Marigold Kitchen has different specials from season to season and changes pretty often. Most of these specials are pretty good. As for their regular <pos>brunch</pos> menu, I think my favorite items from here are their <pos>omelettes</pos>, and I do believe I've tried them all.
