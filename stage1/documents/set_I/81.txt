In Madison for a conference and while there a lot of restaurants around Capital Square, this one stands out for its delicious fare. I liked it so much that I ate there twice in five days. The <pos>quiche</pos> of the day with <pos>greens</pos> was well seasoned and filling, but the portions were not the usual way-too-much on the plate. On a another visit I had the <pos>Roasted Sweet Potato</pos>, <pos>Kale</pos>, and <pos>Basil Walnut Pesto Hash</pos>. It was spectacular - a rich - but not too rich - and tasty melange of flavors that work so well together it is astonishing. No fan of <pos>kale</pos>, I almost skipped this one and I would have missed a great and memorable meal. I ate at five other restaurants in Madison, but none of those others were as good as Marigold Kitchen - a gem in Madison!
