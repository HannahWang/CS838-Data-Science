The food here was heavenly! So many options on the menu. We chose the <pos>pumpkin buckwheat pancakes</pos> with <pos>whipped cinnamon butter</pos>, and <pos>candied pecans</pos> and the <pos>french toast</pos>. The food was so good I didnt want the meal to end! Atmosphere was both quaint and lively. Good vibe. Fresh flowers on the tables. Employees were friendly and energetic. The seating is a little confusing but it was busy that day and staff was helpful. $25 for two for <pos>breakfast</pos> is a little pricey but I dont mind paying that for good quality food...and it was! Will be back to try more!
