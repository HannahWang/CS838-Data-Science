I'm in Madison on business and I spotted this little place on my walk to the restaurant where we had <pos>dinner</pos> last night so I decided to have <pos>breakfast</pos> here this morning. Marigold Kitchen is a nice little placed just down the street from my hotel and they have a somewhat unique spin on your typical <pos>breakfast</pos> with a number of signature dishes like <pos>Duck Confit Hash</pos>, <pos>Roasted Salmon Frittata</pos> and <pos>Tofu Scramble</pos> to name a few. Then there's an interesting variety of <pos>omelets</pos> which is what I ordered, mine came with <pos>bacon</pos>, <pos>parmesan</pos>, <pos>spinach</pos>, <pos>roasted tomatoes</pos> and <pos>cream cheese</pos> and it was very good. The service was fast and friendly. I wouldn't hesitate to return here in the future and strongly suggest you stop by Marigold Kitchen if you're in the area.
