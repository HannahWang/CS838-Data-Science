It's Saturday morning, 4/27/13, the fantastic, authentic Madison Farmer's Market is open for a new season, the Crazylegs Classic is being run today, it's actually sunny and getting warm, and we went back to MK at 7am. It's bustling with all the activity going on but we're fairly early and easily find a table. While placing our order (both great: <pos>bran</pos> and <pos>apricot pancakes</pos> w/real <pos>maple syrup</pos> and the '<pos>Scrambler</pos>') I, as always, ask to have our plates heated in order to keep the great food hot. And to our happy surprise when our <pos>breakfast</pos> was brought out the plates were amazingly HOT!!! and the server had to use extra napkins in order to hold the plates. Yes, I am fixating on heated plates but all along I've said the food is excellent, the atmosphere cozy and warm but just wanted to make it even better with a little tweak. Now if they could only do this for everybody as SOP.
