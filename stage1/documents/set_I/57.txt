Driving through Madison for the 1st time, we were looking for a place for <pos>breakfast</pos>/<pos>brunch</pos>. I had a <pos>spinach</pos> and <pos>bacon omelette</pos> which was served with spicy <pos>potatoes</pos> and <pos>greens</pos> and it was all delicious! The kids had <pos>pancakes</pos> and <pos>bacon</pos> which they ate every bite of, and one had a <pos>cheeseburger</pos> which was also said to be delicious. A little pricey, but the main challenge was just the long wait to order, then the long wait for a table.
