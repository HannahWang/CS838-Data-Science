Four of us went for <pos>lunch</pos>. I have been there for <pos>breakfast</pos> previously and loved it. I had the <pos>scrambler special</pos> on a Saturday about noon. They are only open until 2 pm on Saturday. The line out the door, but moved fairly quickly. The choice of <pos>breads</pos> is exceptional. I had the <pos>rye</pos> and others in my party had the <pos>sourdough</pos>. The <pos>salads</pos> were marvelous with quite a variety of <pos>greens</pos>. The amazing thing here is the freshness of ingredients.The <pos>Marigold potatoes</pos> are excellent, but a little spicy. The <pos>orange juice</pos> is exceptional. It is my favorite <pos>breakfast</pos> and <pos>lunch</pos> spot in Madison so far. If you are in a rush, this place is not for you.
