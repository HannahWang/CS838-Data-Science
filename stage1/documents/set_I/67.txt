My coworkers and I grabbed <pos>breakfast</pos> here before catching our flight home. It was a great spot to grab a quick <pos>breakfast</pos>! The <pos>bacon</pos>, <pos>spinach</pos>, and <pos>cream cheese omelet</pos> was amazing!!! They also have a great selection of <pos>coffees</pos>! The staff members were all super friendly and the service was great! We all really enjoyed our <pos>breakfast</pos> experience at Marigold's! I would love to visit here again if I'm ever back in Madison!
