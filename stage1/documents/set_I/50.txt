Tried the <pos>scramble special</pos>, <pos>coffee</pos> with side of <pos>bacon</pos> (4 pieces $4). Food arrived cold - yet the restaurant was not busy. Got a re-do on the <pos>potatoes</pos> - they were spicy hot, not great, even when warm. <pos>Scramble</pos> - very eggy, not so much <pos>ham</pos>. <pos>Bacon</pos> side also arrived cold; they simply microwaved it, and then over-did it. You'd think a place famous for <pos>breakfast</pos> would have good <pos>coffee</pos> - unfortunately not the case. Hate leaving a poor review as partner really likes the place, however, paying $32 + for <pos>brunch</pos> for 2 was too much for cold food and <pos>coffee</pos> that was not, to say the least, very good.
