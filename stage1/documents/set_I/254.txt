Can be a little on the pricey side but worth it. I had been there before and my husband hadn't and it can be a little overwhelming when you first enter. There are specials on the board but finding menus, especially when it's crowded can be difficult if you don't know where to look. The staff could be a little more helpful in that area. That said, I love the <pos>bacon</pos>, <pos>egg</pos> and <pos>cheese breakfast sandwich</pos>. It is the best. Also recently tried the <pos>chile poached eggs</pos> and now I will have to alternate between the two. Oh, and they have <pos>orange marmalade</pos>, which always is a plus in my book. Really appreciate the fresh take on <pos>breakfast</pos>.
