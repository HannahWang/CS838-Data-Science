There were three in our party and we all enjoyed our <pos>breakfasts</pos>. The large selection made it difficult to decide what to order. We highly recommend the <pos>tofu scrambler</pos>, the <pos>pumpkin buckwheat pancakes</pos> (GF), and the <pos>breakfast potatoes</pos>. Loved the ambiance of Marigold and service was friendly and top-notch.
