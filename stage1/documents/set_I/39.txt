This is unequivocally one of the best <pos>breakfast</pos> places I've ever had the privilege of eating at. Growing up in Chicago good food was pretty much everywhere. I would have never expected such an amazing place to be tucked away in Madison. I regularly get the <pos>Marigold potatoes</pos>, <pos>pumpkin buckwheat pancakes</pos>, <pos>French toast</pos> and the <pos>mushroom broccoli omelette</pos>. All are amazing. If you're ever in Madison Wi, Marigolds is thee <pos>breakfast</pos>. Look no further! You will not be disappointed.
