While staying in Madison for a quick getaway, 3 out of 4 of our hotel's food outlets were "closed for remodeling". So rather than room service or the only hotel option for <pos>breakfast</pos> (a <pos>buffet</pos> in the neighboring building), we decided to venture out to find a local <pos>breakfast</pos> spot. The downtown streets were still snow-packed. We circled our destination 3 times before finding on-street parking across from the restaurant. The effort was worth it! This small funky restaurant was fun and the food was delicious! You order at the counter and they bring you your food. A <pos>coffee</pos>/<pos>tea</pos>/<pos>water</pos> station is well-stocked for self-service. I had the <pos>gluten-free pumpkin pancakes</pos> and John had a <pos>breakfast sandwich</pos>. I loved my <pos>pancakes</pos> and the real <pos>maple syrup</pos>. Great <pos>breakfast</pos>!
