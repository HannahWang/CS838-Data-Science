We tried this splendid place for <pos>lunch</pos> the day we walked down State Street from Campus and around the Capitol. This restaurant is just a block from the Capitol and easy to find. We selected <pos>sandwiches</pos> from the menu and were delighted with the fresh ingredients, the delicious <pos>bread</pos> and the friendly service. The atmosphere is basic, but fun and relaxing.
