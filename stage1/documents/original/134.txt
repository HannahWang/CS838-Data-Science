Over-rated, over-priced and underwhelming food. The location is good; the ambience is nice, but the food disappoints. We went for breakfast and the toast was burned and eggs arrived luke-warm. For the cost, you would expect more.; Over-rated, over-priced and underwhelming food. The location is good; the ambience is nice, but the food disappoints.
