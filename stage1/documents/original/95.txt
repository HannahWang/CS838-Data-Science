Came here for a Mother's Day brunch. I had a Chorizo omelette and it was great. Great outdoor seating although a little small. Cool view of the capital, downtown, & lake Menona. Would come back.; Came here for a Mother's Day brunch. I had a Chorizo omelette and it was great. Great outdoor seating although a little small. Cool view of the capital, downtown, & lake Menona.
