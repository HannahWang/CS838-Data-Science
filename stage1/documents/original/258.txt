This place is right downtown Madison, just off the square. The food is really good (at least the 2 breakfast items we had). Seems like good fresh ingredients, and well prepared recipes. The price is probably comparable to an average breaksfast style restaurant (Dennys, Ihop)....More; This place is right downtown Madison, just off the square.
