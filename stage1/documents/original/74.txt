We had a lovely lunch at Marigold Kitchen. Everything was fresh and natural, prices were very reasonable, and the food was delicious. The setting was cozy and comfortable - very casual.; We had a lovely lunch at Marigold Kitchen. Everything was fresh and natural, prices were very reasonable, and the food was delicious.
