We passed on a free hotel breakfast for Marigold. The place was very busy. We ordered at the counter , got seated and were finished eating in 30 min! The food quality is excellent, the service is very efficient. Don't let the long lines scare...More; We passed on a free hotel breakfast for Marigold. The place was very busy.
