Wow this is a wonderful place for breakfast! The wait staff was polite and very friendly. There was a bunch of young families, couples, old guys, and group singles all having a grand time. The food was fabulous. You do have to wait in line...More; Wow this is a wonderful place for breakfast! The wait staff was polite and very friendly.
