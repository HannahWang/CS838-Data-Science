Wonderful brunch. They professionally handle the huge crowds with friendliness. The cappuccino was very bitter though. They use local ingredients and prepare the food fresh each day.; Wonderful brunch. They professionally handle the huge crowds with friendliness. The cappuccino was very bitter though.
