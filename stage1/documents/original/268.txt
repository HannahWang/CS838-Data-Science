The best scones (next to the ones from Lazy Jane's) we've ever had. Duck Confit hash was my favorite. Coffee was above usual restaurant-diner fare. Gets crowded, fairly small sitting area..worth the wait out in the street.; The best scones (next to the ones from Lazy Jane's) we've ever had. Duck Confit hash was my favorite.
