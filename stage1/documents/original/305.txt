Great breakfast. Don't be swayed by the line to get in. They turn tables quickly. The pastries are outstanding. The chili poached eggs are awesome. French toast is a little sweet for my taste, but my wife liked them. The staff is extremely friendly.; Great breakfast. Don't be swayed by the line to get in. They turn tables quickly.
