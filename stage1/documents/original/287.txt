My husband and I were starving and we just happened upon this restaurant. He got the Gorgonzola burger and I had the tuna melt. Both were FANTASTIC. Definitely a great stop for lunch.; My husband and I were starving and we just happened upon this restaurant. He got the Gorgonzola burger and I had the tuna melt. Both were FANTASTIC.
