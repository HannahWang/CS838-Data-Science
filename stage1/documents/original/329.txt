What a great place for breakfast. Unusual meal choices. We had the daily scramble. It included their potatoes, toast, greens with a vinaigrette and we added a scone to share. Coffee was great. Staff is excellent, very attentive and friendly. You order at the counter...More; What a great place for breakfast. Unusual meal choices. We had the daily scramble.
