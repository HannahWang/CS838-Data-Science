Stopped here while visiting Madison for a Badger football game. We visited with a party of 5 and everyone enjoyed their meals. I ordered the duck confit hash and it was very good. All commented on how delicious the potatoes were.; Stopped here while visiting Madison for a Badger football game. We visited with a party of 5 and everyone enjoyed their meals.
