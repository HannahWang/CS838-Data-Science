My wife and I did lunch here in October 2017. Artisan sandwiches “sammies” with fresh orange juice and local beer. Good food and service ideally situated for pre- or post- Capitol tours. Clean restrooms. We would definitely lunch here again.; My wife and I did lunch here in October 2017. Artisan sandwiches “sammies” with fresh orange juice and local beer.
