Finding ourselves up at 7 am we were delighted to visit Marigold. The staff was friendly and fast. The food was great-- the house special duck confit was good but the daily scrambler special took the prize. Fun atmosphere and good coffee.; Finding ourselves up at 7 am we were delighted to visit Marigold. The staff was friendly and fast.
