My friend rented out this place which is normally only open during the day for her rehearsal dinner. The atmosphere was fabulous and trendy, the food was delish! We had <pos>appetizers</pos> of <pos>caponata</pos> and <pos>hummus</pos> with <pos>pita</pos> and <pos>veggies</pos>. Then we had a <pos>buffet</pos> with great <pos>mixed greens</pos> and a variety of <pos>gourment sandwiches</pos> cut into quarters.
