This was our first time at Marigold Kitchen. It was so delightful and tasty that we came back the next day! It reminded us of the many restaurants we enjoyed in San Francisco during our visits there. The food was fresh and wholesome! They had a variety of <pos>breakfast</pos> and <pos>lunch</pos> selections! We loved the homemade <pos>scones</pos> and <pos>muffins</pos>! The <pos>coffee</pos> was excellent! Waitstaff was friendly and the restaurant very clean!
