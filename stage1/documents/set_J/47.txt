Decided last minute to try a <pos>breakfast</pos> place and wanted one walking distance from our hotel on capitol square. Reviews were good for this place and boy, it did not disappoint. Were very impressed with the flavor and quality of the <pos>breakfast</pos> food we had. <pos>Ham</pos> and <pos>gruyere omelet</pos> and <pos>Marigold breakfast sandwich</pos> were so delicious. The flavors were so rich and wonderful, both of us really enjoyed our meal. We also liked the decor of the place. While small, it was bustling and yet it didn't feel crowded. It's worth the money for a quality <pos>breakfast</pos> meal. Don't hesitate to try it!
