My last day in Madison, looking for a filling and good meal in a charming spot to get me through the long flights home. Well, I found it! Orders are placed at the counter, and you get the classic number stand to ID where the <pos>breakfast</pos> should land. The girl at the counter was rather clueless and not particularly flexible, so I was not just unable to get the <pos>ham</pos> (which comes with an <pos>omelet</pos> but not with the <pos>egg</pos> meals) instead of <pos>bacon</pos> (too fatty), but came away without the <pos>bacon</pos> either. Even with that, the <pos>eggs</pos> were perfectly prepared and particularly richly flavored, and the <pos>potatoes</pos> very good. These were the first edible <pos>potatoes</pos> I had had in Madison, where <pos>potatoes</pos> generally seem ill-favored. The ambiance and clientele were warm and interesting. A good spot!
