It was close to my hotel so I went there the first day for <pos>breakfast</pos>. <pos>Pancakes</pos> were amazing. I ended up going back there every day for <pos>breakfast</pos> during my stay. Tried the <pos>blueberry pancakes</pos> (wow) <pos>pumpkin pancakes</pos> (wow again) and then they had a special, <pos>steel cut oat pancakes</pos> with black currents, delicious! The <pos>coffee</pos> is also stellar. It's friendly and comfortable.
