Being good cooks, at home in Madison my husband and I don't go out to eat muchâ€”except for <pos>breakfast</pos> at the Marigold Kitchen. I simply cannot recommend this place more highly. I'm addicted to their <pos>Chili Poached Eggs</pos>, while my husband can't resist their take on the <pos>breakfast sandwich</pos>.
