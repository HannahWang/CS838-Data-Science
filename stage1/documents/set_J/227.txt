I've tried this restaurant twice, months apart, hoping in vain that the greasy <pos>breakfast</pos> was a fluke. I think if you pressed the <pos>potatoes</pos> that come with the <pos>eggs</pos>, you would get enough oil to power your vehicle. My <pos>omelet</pos> was grey, an indication of an improperly cleaned grill.
