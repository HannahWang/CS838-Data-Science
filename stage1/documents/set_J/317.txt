It's a travesty that Marigold isn't listed as #1. It's a nice casual place just off the Capital Square. The thing I love most is that I always can find about 4 or 5 things that sound great; every single time my order has been great. You can be in and out in about 20 minutes if you need to be, but it's also a cool place to hang out. It's got a nice local feel but tends to be a bit noisy, so conversation could be difficult. After <pos>lunch</pos>, they have a counter case filled with wonderful <pos>bars</pos>, <pos>cookies</pos>, etc.
