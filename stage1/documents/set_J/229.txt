What a great spot. First time in MAD town and we shuffled thru TA as usual to find a spot for <pos>breakfast</pos>. Just great. Fresh and Authentic food and great service leave your tummies full and face tight with smiles. The <pos>daily scramble</pos> is phenomenal with local <pos>potatoes</pos> really tasty.
