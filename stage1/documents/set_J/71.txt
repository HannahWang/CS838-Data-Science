This place serves lovely <pos>omelettes</pos> and <pos>pancakes</pos>. They have a fresh <pos>heirloom tomato bloody Marry</pos>. Prices we mid range and usual for Madison. The place is busy on weekends and quite noisy if you sit inside. Expect to eat and leave- you pay at the counter when placing an order, so you can't really relax with a <pos>coffee</pos> after eating.
