Marigold has been a staple off the square for years. For that reason, they are very busy, but they've mastered a system to speed things along. Be prepared to wait in line to order, then find a table. The menu is varied with classic American <pos>breakfast</pos> and some <pos>Mexican dishes</pos> as well. The food is great, but if you're looking for a place to linger for awhile, you'd probably be better off going elsewhere.
