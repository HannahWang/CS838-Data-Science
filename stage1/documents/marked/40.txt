I had the <pos>bacon</pos> and <pos>spinach omelet</pos> with <pos>potatoes</pos> and <pos>toast</pos>. Every single item had some uniqueness to it and they were all delicious. The <pos>omelet</pos> had <pos>sun dried tomato</pos> and different <pos>cheeses</pos>, the <pos>potatoes</pos> were pan friend with a nice crust on them and the <pos>toast</pos> was a perfectly toasted <pos>rosemary bread</pos>. The service was also very nice!
