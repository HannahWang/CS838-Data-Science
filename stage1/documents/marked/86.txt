In town on business - stopped in for <pos>breakfast</pos> the other day and just loved it! We'd never been there before and happen to arrive at opening. Good thing we did as the place just filled up after us. We really wanted just a good, down-home <pos>breakfast</pos> and couldn't have been happier! <pos>Eggs</pos> cooked perfectly, killer <pos>blueberry pancakes</pos>, great <pos>bacon</pos> and <pos>coffee</pos> and a super friendly staff! Highest marks and I am looking for an opportunity to get back there!
