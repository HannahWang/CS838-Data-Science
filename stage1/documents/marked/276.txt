We love <pos>breakfast</pos> at local diners that shine. The Marigold Kitchen is local, and the people are very nice, but the <pos>baked goods</pos> were heavy, the <pos>eggs</pos> while I'm sure they were organic as advertised, can't have been free range as the <pos>yolks</pos> were a pale yellow, the <pos>potatoes</pos> were grease-soaked, the <pos>toast</pos> was good, but not great.
