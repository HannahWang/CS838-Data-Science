Went for a great <pos>brunch</pos> - have options ranging from <pos>eggs</pos> and <pos>bacon</pos> to specials like the <pos>chicken tostada</pos> (tasty good). They offer gourmet <pos>coffee drinks</pos> as well. Loved the funky vibe, friendly service, and the food was oh-so-tasty. Would recommend as a place for <pos>breakfast</pos> or <pos>lunch</pos>.
