Had <pos>lunch</pos> at Marigolds this past week with family, including a 10 month old. A great place to grab <pos>coffee</pos>, <pos>bakery</pos>, or have meal. We all loved our choices from the specials of the day - <pos>blackberry pancakes</pos>, <pos>sweet potato hash</pos> /<pos>scramble</pos> with <pos>kale</pos> and <pos>walnut pesto</pos> - yum!! - and <pos>sandwiches</pos>. I also took some <pos>lemon currant scones</pos> for <pos>breakfast</pos> the following day and they were very good.
