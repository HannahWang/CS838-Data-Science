Stopped there for <pos>lunch</pos> with my wife and my niece. A cute place that is conveniently located just around the corner from the capitol building in Madison. My wife liked her <pos>Tuscan chicken salad</pos>, but I thought my <pos>grilled cheese</pos> and <pos>turkey sandwich</pos> was strictly average and that I could make a better one in our kitchen microwave, and my <pos>red cabbage coleslaw</pos> had no taste at all.
