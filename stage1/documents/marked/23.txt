We were on a road trip and had looked up reviews on Trip Advisor for <pos>breakfast</pos> in Madison and this showed up. It did not disappoint. I had the short stack of <pos>blueberry pancakes</pos> and we also ordered their <pos>breakfast potatoes</pos>. Very good and more than we could eat. Ordered specialty <pos>coffees</pos> and they were excellent. Friendly staff and great service.
