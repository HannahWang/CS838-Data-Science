Seeing the line almost scared us off. So glad I didn't let my impatience cause us to eat somewhere else! Our wait from the door to ordering was about 15 minutes. The atmosphere is comfortable, and we could watch them cooking, bussing, and serving around the spaces while we waited in line. We ordered their <pos>orange</pos> and <pos>ricotta pancakes</pos>, the <pos>roasted sweet potato</pos>, <pos>kale</pos>, and <pos>walnut hash</pos>, and, a <pos>scrambler</pos>. Everything took about 15 minutes to get to our table, and it all was hot and delicious. Nice that they had marmalade sitting on the table. Added a bit to give my <pos>pancakes</pos> an even more orangey flavor. Would eat here again, and look forward to trying something else.
