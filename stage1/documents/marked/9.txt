We love this little cafe for <pos>breakfast</pos> and <pos>brunch</pos>. You order at the counter, then sit down at a table and are served when the food is ready. They have very good <pos>lattes</pos> and other <pos>beverages</pos>, but also full <pos>breakfasts</pos> (and creative ones), not just <pos>pastries</pos> and <pos>breakfast sandwiches</pos>. This time we didnâ€™t arrive until around 1 pm on a Sunday and by then there was no line. It closes at 2 pm. We drive over from the university area, but there is a parking garage just around the corner, so parking had never been a problem.
