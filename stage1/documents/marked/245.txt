Went here on a cold Sunday late morning. You stand in line, order your food, and by the time you pay, a waiter will help you secure a table. If the line goes out the door, you'll be waiting at least 20 minutes. We got in line in the restaraunt, so the wait was only about 10 minutes. We ordered <pos>coffee</pos>, a mini <pos>doughnut muffin</pos> and <pos>blackberry</pos>/<pos>cranberry scone</pos> and sat down to wait for our <pos>entrees</pos>. The <pos>doughnut muffin</pos> was awesome, soft and comforting. I wished the <pos>scone</pos> would have been only <pos>blackberry</pos> (<pos>cranberry</pos> was too tangy) but it was fine. The <pos>duck confit hash</pos> was MINDBLOWING! So rich and flavorful, I only ate half and took the rest home. It came with a deliciously dressed <pos>mixed green salad</pos> and two <pos>eggs</pos> to order. My husband had a <pos>feta</pos>/<pos>bacon</pos>/<pos>spinach omlette</pos> and really enjoyed it. It also contained a bit of <pos>cream cheese</pos> and that smoothed the flavors out nicely. <pos>Coffee</pos> is a restaurant blend of local Alterra, which was well-balanced. The atmosphere is lively, but a bit rushed...kind of felt like a Manhattan breakfast spot. There seemed to be a lull after 11:30am, so we may try to show up at that time instead of 10:30am. With 2 <pos>coffees</pos>, 2 <pos>pastries</pos>, 2 <pos>entrees</pos>, our bill was around 30 bucks plus tip. Reasonable price for a treat a few times a year.
