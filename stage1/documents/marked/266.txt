The Kitchen was packed on a Thursday morning when we spouses of wives in Madison on business met for breakfast. There are 'Marigolds' in every mid-to-large city - a little hip but still casual and friendly. There were all ages, students, professionals, people in flannel and tailored wool, and likely a broad range of lifestyles. Anyone should be comfortable at the Marigold. At 8 AM on a weekday, it might be a waiting line at arrival, but the turnover seems good. There is free Wi-Fi, so a few tables were "stuck." Our meals were well-priced and not just the normal diner fare. Service is: menu at the table, specials on the blackboard, and pay as you order at the counter. <pos>Coffee</pos> is self-serve and unlimited. There is a condiment hutch at the <pos>coffee</pos> / <pos>water</pos> desk to spice up your food or flavor your <pos>coffee</pos>. Food was prepared quickly and served very hot. My request for more <pos>syrup</pos> at the cooking station was met with an immediate hand-off of another hot mini-cup of <pos>syrup</pos>. A colleague mis-read a menu item and didn't catch that his <pos>diced potato side</pos> did include <pos>meat</pos>. His whole food <pos>breakfast</pos> plate was immediately replaced. That's good service! The restaurant is an easy walk from the Capital, city hall, many offices, and our hotel adjacent to the Convention Center.
