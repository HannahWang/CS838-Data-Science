I love this place. The <pos>breakfast</pos> is delicious. Everyone who works there is always smiling and helpful. I got the <pos>eggs</pos>, <pos>potatoes</pos> and <pos>toast</pos> (gluten free!). I will go back again before I leave Madison maybe for <pos>lunch</pos> and get the gluten free <pos>dessert</pos>!
