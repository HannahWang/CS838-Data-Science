We love this place, but the fact that they will only offer highly spiced <pos>potatoes</pos> for <pos>breakfast</pos> is a major bummer. These <pos>potatoes</pos> overpower the flavor of everything! Why not plain potatoes? So now instead we order the <pos>salad greens</pos>, and thank goodness they have these as they make a nice <pos>breakfast</pos> compliment for, $2.00 more. But, you have to get the <pos>dressing</pos> on the side or they come out soggy.
