Loved everything here! I got there <pos>black iced coffee</pos> which was so refreshingly good. I also got the <pos>chilaquiles</pos> and my friends got the <pos>salmon frittata</pos> and the <pos>duck hash</pos> which were all very delicious! The <pos>chilaquiles</pos> were a bit spicy though but I love...
