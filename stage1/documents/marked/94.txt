I am soooooooooo thrilled my daughter took me here. Everything my family ordered was amazing!!!!! I will return! Marigolds is walking distance from the Hyatt, which was convenient. I ordered the <pos>corn cakes</pos> with a <pos>rhubarb peach</pos> topping that was so delicious I did not have to put the <pos>syrup</pos> on. Yummy I can't wait to return.
