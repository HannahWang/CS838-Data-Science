Had to find a good <pos>breakfast</pos> near the convention center. This was closest and turned out to be the best - ever. Great food made by people that seemed interested in providing healthy, hearty and varied choices. We ditched the convention center (free) <pos>breakfast</pos> for this place, three mornings in a row.
