We had heard a lot of positive comments about this place and wanted to try it. From the moment we came in the door to the time we left, the place was great. All of the staff warmly greeted us -- what a rarity in the restaurant world! The <pos>sandwiches</pos> were excellent and filling - <pos>tea</pos> and <pos>coffee</pos> better than most. Service was fast and the food came to the table within minuets. This place is also in a great location in Madison - about a block from the Capitol. We will stop in again next time we are in Madison.
