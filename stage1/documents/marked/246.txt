I was not impressed with my overall experience here, basically for some of the same reasons other reviewers have mentioned - although for them being rushed in and out seems to be of little concern. The biggest issue is the pretentious expectation that you must order before finding a seat, and then being asked by waitstaff before finishing my <pos>coffee</pos> to vacate the table. Not only being asked to leave...but asked to leave twice in a 3 minute period. For the price I have not only had better food with better portions, but not been rushed out of the restaurant. When my friends and I go to <pos>brunch</pos> we don't want "fast food" - we go to eat lazily together, talk about life and enjoy our food and <pos>coffee</pos>. Again, for the price and the quality of the food I could think of far better restaurants that don't rush you out the door just to make more money on another party. <pos>Brunch</pos> is meant to be enjoyed, and you won't be able to enjoy it for long in this place!. Not going back and not recommending to anyone.
