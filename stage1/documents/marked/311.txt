Really loved this place. Their food was so fresh and I had this delicious <pos>chile-braised chicken sandwich</pos> (it was like <pos>pulled chicken</pos>..very tender) with <pos>roasted tomatillos</pos>, <pos>chihuahua cheese</pos>, <pos>chipotle lime dressing</pos>, <pos>shredded romaine</pos>, <pos>red onion</pos> and <pos>cilantro</pos> on a <pos>rustic roll</pos> and my friend had <pos>Bacon</pos>, <pos>arugula</pos> and <pos>tomato</pos> with <pos>whipped cream cheese</pos> and <pos>pepper jelly</pos> on <pos>rosemary</pos>.
