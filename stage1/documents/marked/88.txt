I've had several friends highly recommend the Marigold Kitchen, so we decided to try it for <pos>lunch</pos> this week. We got there a little before noon and there was a line to the door. Ordering takes place a the counter and they have menus to peruse while you are waiting in line. The menu consists of <pos>breakfast</pos> items as well as <pos>sandwiches</pos>, <pos>salads</pos>, and <pos>soups</pos> for <pos>lunch</pos>. I decided on the <pos>Marigold Italian</pos>: <pos>Salami</pos>, <pos>Spicy Capicola ham</pos>, <pos>aioli</pos>, <pos>provolone</pos>, and <pos>fris√©e</pos> with a <pos>pickled vegetable relish</pos> on a <pos>toasted baguette</pos>. We arrived at the counter, placed our order, got a number, and found a table to wait for our drinks and meals to arrive.
