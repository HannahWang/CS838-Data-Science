Sometimes the top rated restaurant on tripadvisor and yelp isn't as good as the reviews lead you to believe, that is not the case at Marigold Kitchen. This place is fantastic. The ambience, the food, the drinks were all excellent. I recommend the <pos>Whole Grain</pos> and <pos>Ginger Soy Saute</pos>, I wish that I could eat that every morning for <pos>breakfast</pos>. I was full almost the entire day after that.
