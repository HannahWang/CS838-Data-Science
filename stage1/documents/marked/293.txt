This place supposedly has the best <pos>breakfast</pos> in Madison, well that was not my experience. My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out because we always go to Monty's Blue Plate dinner and thought we'd try something new. I ordered a <pos>scramble</pos> that comes with <pos>potatoes</pos>.
