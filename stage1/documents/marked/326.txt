While staying in Madison for a quick getaway, 3 out of 4 of our hotel's food outlets were "closed for remodeling". So rather than room service or the only hotel option for <pos>breakfast</pos> (a <pos>buffet</pos> in the neighboring building), we decided to venture out to find a local <pos>breakfast</pos> spot.
