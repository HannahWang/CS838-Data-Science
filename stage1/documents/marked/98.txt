The day we ate there they had hostess seating, meaning you had to order and get your number before the hostess would seat you. Their etiquette - printed on signs - directs you to order before seating. Despite this, people in the long line kept grabbing tables for their party. The hostess caught some but not all, and it contributed to an undercurrent in the order line. After ordering you wait for a table in a small area near where servers come out of the kitchen. Once seated, the tables are pretty close together. In short, if you want a leisurely dining experience, head on down the road. The food itself was very good, verging on excellent. The dishes we ordered - <pos>French toast</pos> and the <pos>breakfast sandwich</pos> - were a little on the small side. Nothing that could not be cured by rounding out the order with a few <pos>scones</pos>.
