First time here. You walk in the door grab a menu from the post and get in line to order. After you r order is taken you are given a number so you can go find a table. We were there on a Sunday at 10AM. We had no problem finding a table. There is seating inside and out.Two of us had the special of the day which was a <pos>Scrambler</pos>, made with <pos>eggs</pos>, <pos>ham</pos>, <pos>veggies</pos> and <pos>sweet potatoes</pos>. I came with a <pos>American fries</pos> that were seasoned. We also got a <pos>salmon frittata</pos> which came with a <pos>mixed green salad</pos>. The food was a good portion and very tasty. About $36 for three of us.
