Living in Madison, I've eaten at Marigold Kitchen on five or so different occasions. I'll start with the positives, the food. I've had a variety of different <pos>breakfast</pos> and <pos>brunch</pos> dishes: <pos>pancakes</pos>, <pos>scrabblers</pos>, <pos>quiche</pos>, and <pos>eggs benedict</pos>. The <pos>pancakes</pos> and <pos>eggs benedict</pos> were nothing better than average, the <pos>scrabblers</pos> and <pos>quiche</pos> were quite good.
