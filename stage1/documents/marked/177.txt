Looking for a late <pos>breakfast</pos> is sometimes hard and selections are limited but not at this restaurant. My husband and I were surprised at the wonderful selection of <pos>breakfast</pos> items served all day. We had the <pos>granola pancakes</pos> with fresh <pos>berries</pos> and a <pos>special syrup</pos>.
