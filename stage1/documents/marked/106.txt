I was so happy to be staying very close to this restaurant on a warmish February weekend in February because for me and my husband, starting the day in a fun, vibrant place is a must for travel days. We went here based on the reviews, but we didn't have the great experience that most have had here. Mostly, the reason was that the place was not just busy ... it was operating above capacity. (I want to reiterate that I love busy, eclectic places, but there were far too many people in this place). The method of service is a good idea, actually - you stand in line and place your order at a counter, and then you are given a number. Ideally, you can then sit down and enjoy a <pos>beverage</pos> while waiting for the food. Instead, we stood there awkwardly for about 5 minutes holding our mugs, tea caddies, and number on tall holder until a table cleared. When we tried to sit there, we were shuffled to a smaller table which was not yet clean. Lots of fancy <pos>coffee</pos> options, but far few <pos>teas</pos> and the menu was rather small (not like a traditional diner). There were some pastries, etc that looked good but we didn't try them. I ordered a short stack (2) <pos>butter milk pancakes</pos>, and we laughed when they brought them out - they were literally the smallest I have ever been served, more like silver-dollar <pos>pancakes</pos>. They were garnished with exactly one and half <pos>strawberries</pos> cut into 6 slices. My husband had the <pos>french toast</pos>, which he felt was fine. Finally, we disliked the serve it yourself tea situation, where we filled our own hot water, etc. We did expect more of a sit-down restaurant, and felt like the food price didn't really match the do-it-yourself experience. Overall, it was a disappointment, but at least the food tasted good, and the employees really were trying hard (but they were set-up to fail and have frustrations just because so many people are crammed in there).
