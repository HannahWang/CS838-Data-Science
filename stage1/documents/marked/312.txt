To appreciate Marigold, you have to understand that service is not really what this restaurant is about. The wait staff gets the job done, but the real star is the food. The <pos>coffee</pos> and <pos>water</pos> are both self-service, and you place your order at the register, then hope that a table frees up in time for you to be served.
