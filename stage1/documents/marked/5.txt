I love marigold kitchen! It’s bustling atmosphere is energizing and the food is incredible. I love the <pos>chorizo omelet</pos> but their <pos>daily specials</pos> are always incredible too! Everybody is in a good mood and the bright colors create a happy environment even on the most dreary of days. It’s convenient for the farmers market and though always packed, you’ll find a table before your food comes. I love this place!
